            <p>Growing up during the dawn of an era of such enduring advancements like Furbies, LazerDiscs, and Windows ME,
                I have always had a fascination with technology. Eventually, that curiousity would lead me to the development
                trail I have taken. Please, take a look a look around, and let me know if my works tickle your fancy or somehow
                cause an insatiable appetite for candy corn.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Hailing from the urban tundra of Chicago, I am a grizzled veteran of the harsh climes of the Midwest. When I'm
                not developing, you can catch me seeking out local gems for food, drink, and adventure. I also try to experience
                adventures abroad whenever possible. Throw a novel activity my way, and I'll probably be glad to join you.</p>
